career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary: |
      Cell biologist studying how cells perceive their environments and respond with discrete behaviors. Interests include pharmacology, automated quantitative image analysis, teaching, and mentoring.

research:
    title: Research
    intro: |
      Our cells have have a limited number of tools to sense their environment,
      but they have to be capable of responding to a practically unlimited number of
      environmental signals. I study how cells decode different signals acting on the
      same machinery to produce distinct behaviors. Currently, I use the convergent
      signaling molecule cyclic AMP to study this, but in the past I have also used
      G protein-coupled receptors.

    projects:
      - title: Sentinel cells for genetic encoded responses to pathogens
        graphic: sarsnotch.png
        summary: |
          Current therapies targeting viral and microbial pathogens rely on systemically administered treatments
          with profound potential for off-target effects. With our 'sentinel cells', we propose a model that has shown
          considerable target in treating blood cancers, where engineered cells can sense and respond to pathogenic
          threats locally and intelligently. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a model pathogen, we demonstrate that sentinel cells can
          detect infected cells, and respond with customized genetic programs. These sentinel cells have potential as both
          antipathogen therapies as well as in novel drug and therapeutic development.
      - title: Endocytic dwell time of the µ opioid receptor regulates signaling in a ligand depdenent manner
        graphic: molpharm-summary.png
        summary: |
          The µ opiod receptor (µOR) is the target of drugs like morphine and heroin. But it is also the target of
          chemicals our bodies produce called endorphins. It is poorly understood why morphine is so addictive,
          but endorphins are not. One difference between how these drugs act on µOR is that morphine causes the receptor
          to be taken up into the cell very quickly after it interacts with the drug. I discovered that the slower this uptake
          occurs, the more signaling is produced from the MAPK signaling pathway. This signaling difference might
          contribute to the ways in which endogenous opioids have different effects comapred to exogenous ones.
