career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am using comparative cell biology and biochemical reconstitution to understand fundamental principles underlying intracellular transport.

    intro: |
      ZARA'S - Our cells have have a limited number of tools to sense their environment,
      but they have to be capable of responding to a practically unlimited number of
      environmental signals. I study how cells decode different signals acting on the
      same machinery to produce distinct behaviors. Currently, I use the convergent
      signaling molecule cyclic AMP to study this, but in the past I have also used
      G protein-coupled receptors.

    projects:
      - title: Duplication and loss of transport-related genes impact intracellular transport in the fungal kingdom
        graphic: sarsnotch.png
        summary: |
          Via my comparative genomics analysis, I have identified that different fungi have different combinations of transport-related
          genes encoded in their genomes, suggesting that intracellular transport may be fine-tuned in conjunction with cellular characteristics
          present in distinct fungal clades.
      - title: Cargo transport diversity in human cells  via combinatorial assembly of dynein adaptor complexes

        summary: |
          The µ opiod receptor (µOR) is the target of drugs like morphine and heroin. But it is also the target of
          chemicals our bodies produce called endorphins. It is poorly understood why morphine is so addictive,
          but endorphins are not. One difference between how these drugs act on µOR is that morphine causes the receptor
          to be taken up into the cell very quickly after it interacts with the drug. I discovered that the slower this uptake
          occurs, the more signaling is produced from the MAPK signaling pathway. This signaling difference might
          contribute to the ways in which endogenous opioids have different effects comapred to exogenous ones.
