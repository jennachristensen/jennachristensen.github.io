      Cytoskeletal biologist using comparative cell biology and biochemical reconstitution to understand fundamental principles and novel modes of intracellular transport.

    intro: |
      Across the tree of life, cells display remarkable diversity in traits including cellular organization, gene expression, and morphology, 
      among others. These adaptations are critical to the survival of a cell or organism within its unique environment. To perform fundamental 
      cellular processes, each cell must be able to transport cargos such as organelles, vesicles, and mRNAs with spatial and temporal precision. 
      Despite understanding many of the players involved in intracellular transport, little is known about why some organisms use one mode of transport 
      over another. My research vision is to determine the fundamental principles behind how and when cells use different modes of cargo transport. 
      By studying organisms across the tree of life, we can both parse the underlying themes and potentially unearth new modes of intracellular transport.

      - title: Duplication and loss of transport-related genes impact intracellular transport in the fungal kingdom
        graphic: nuclei.gif
        summary: |
          The dikaryotic fungi are an ideal group of organisms in which to study intracellular transport diversification as they exhibit a wide range
          of phenotypic diversity, include species known to use actin- and/or microtubule-dependent transport, and encompass many species that are 
          already genetically tractable. I use comparative genomics to identify transport-related genes encoded in the genomes of different dikaryotic fungi
          in order to generate hypotheses concerning intracellular transport adaptation in different contexts.
          My research has found that different fungi have different combinations of transport-related genes encoded in their genomes, suggesting that intracellular transport may be fine-tuned in conjunction with cellular 
          characteristics present in distinct fungal clades. I am now using comparative cell biology in different fungal species to directly test these hypotheses.
      - title: Using insights from fungi to study human cells - gene family expansion in human cells affects transport processes
        graphic: FHIP2A.gif
        summary: |
          Unlike filamentous fungi, in which cellular cargos are often distributed consistently throughout a hyphal network, cargo transport in human cells 
          must be multi-dimensional, comprehensive, and responsive. Correspondingly, human cells have evolved a large series of functionally distinct motors 
          and adaptors. As one example, the filamentous fungus <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i> has one each of the FTS, Hook, and FHIP proteins, which collectively 
          form the ‘FHF’ complex and link dynein to early endosomes. In comparison, human cells have three Hook, four FHIP proteins, and one FTS. I <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/74538">discovered</a> 
          that gene family expansion and functional divergence of FHF complex proteins allow dynein to bind multiple cargos in human cells. Many transport-related
          gene families have similarly expanded in humans. My future work uses fungi as models to investigate general roles and mechanisms of transport-related proteins,
          and then uses cellular proteomics and cell biology to discover how those processes have diverged or expanded in human cells.
      - title: Reconstitution of transport processes
        graphic: actin.gif
        summary: |
          Factors such as cytoskeletal organization, motor composition, and post-translational modifications can affect intracellular transport on the molecular level.
          By reconstituting different transport machineries and visualizing their activity via single molecule TIRF microscopy, we can elucidate the roles that these factors and others play
          in the transport of cargos in different organisms.
